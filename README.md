# Knowledge Graphs in the era of Large Language Models

This PhD course is organised in 4 sessions of 3 hours each combining theory and practice.
This course is a tailored version of [City's Semantic Web Technologies and Knowledge Graphs module](https://github.com/turing-knowledge-graphs/teaching/tree/main/city).

## Setting-up 

The example codes will be in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tested with Python version >=3.10). I strongly recommend using Python environments to use the right library versions.
Follow the instructions in the [lab session 0](https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs/phd-course/blob/main/labs/phd-course-kgs-aalborg-lab-session-0.pdf) and run the scripts in the [test folder](https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs/phd-course/tree/main/python/test) to check you have the required infrastructure and Python libraries.

To avoid clashes with the changes on the main branch it is suggested to add generated codes and data in the folder [student-codes-data](https://github.com/city-knowledge-graphs/phd-course/tree/main/python/student-codes-data).
