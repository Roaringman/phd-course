# Knowledge Graphs in the era of Large Language Models

This PhD course is organised in 4 sessions of 3 hours each combining theory and practice.

## Setting-up 

The example codes will be in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tested with Python version >=3.10). I strongly recommend using python environments to use the right library versions.
Follow the instructions in

- Laboratory: Creating a small KG and ontology (Lab notes)
- Support codes.

## Session 2
- Lecture: Knowledge Graphs and Semantics (Slides)
- Laboratory: SPARQL and Reasoning (Lab notes)
- Support codes.

## Session 3
- Lecture: Matching (Slides)
- Laboratory: KG alignment and Tabular data to KG matching (Lab notes)
- Support codes.
  
## Session 4
- Lecture: KGs and LLMs (Slides)
